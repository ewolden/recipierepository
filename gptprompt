I am transforming food recipes into a specific markdown format. Your role is to be the markdown developer. You will try to make the instructions as concise as possible. Any mentions of degrees farenheit should be translated to degrees celcius. This is the format I want to end up with, commented for your ease:

+++
author = "Eivind Halm√∏y Wolden"
title = "Title"
date = "Todays date"
description = "One sentence description of the recipe"
tags = [
    leave this field blank

categories = [

]
image = "leave this field blank"
prepTime = "How long does the preparation of the ingredients take"
cookTime = "How long is the cooking time"
recipeYield = "How many portions does this recipe yield"
ingredients = [ Ingredients listed alphabetically

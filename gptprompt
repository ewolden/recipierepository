I am transforming food recipes into a specific markdown format. Your role is to be the markdown developer. You will try to make the instructions as concise as possible. Any mentions of degrees farenheit should be translated to degrees celcius, any mention of oz should be translated to grams (rounded to nearest 10g), and any mention of inches should be translated to cm (rounded). Do not convert amounts in tbsp, tsp, cups. In the method, make sure to include the amounts required in each step in bold along with the ingredient. Remove kosher and just leave salt from any mention of kosher salt. This is the format I want to end up with, commented for your ease. Put any times in the frontmatter, in these 4 categories: prepTime, cookTime, chillTime, restTime. Please give the response with a codeblock around the markdown. Make sure to include all the fields specified. Remove any "sales" pitch from the title, such as quick, easy, tasty etc. Give some suggested tags for this recipe in the tags array in the frontmatter:

+++
author = "Eivind Halm√∏y Wolden"
title = "Title"
date = "Insert todays date here in YYYY-MM-DD format"
description = "One sentence description of the recipe"
tags = [
    
]
categories = [
    
]
image = "leave this field blank"
prepTime = "How long does the preparation of the ingredients take"
cookTime = "How long is the cooking time"
recipeYield = "How many portions does this recipe yield"
ingredients = [ Ingredients listed alphabetically
]

---|---|---
Butter | 300 g | melted
Water | 3.5 dl | 
Cacao powder | 6 tbsp | 
Eggs | 3 | 
Sour cream | 1 beger | 
Baking soda | 2 tsp |

### Ingredients for Frosting
Ingredient | Quantity | How
---|---|---
Butter | 200 g | room temperature
Powdered sugar | 5 dl | 
Cacao powder | 2 tbsp | 
Coffee | 3 tbsp | 

### Method for Chocolate Cake

#### Step 1
Melt **300 g butter** and place it in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients, with **7 dl flour** added last.

#### Step 2
Grease a small baking pan (approximately 25x35 cm) and line it with baking paper. Pour the batter into the pan.

#### Step 3
Bake the cake on the bottom rack of the oven at **180°C** for 30-40 minutes. Check with a wooden stick to see if the cake is done; if nothing sticks to the stick, the cake is ready. Cool the cake on a wire rack.

### Method for Frosting

#### Step 4
Mix together **200 g butter**, **5 dl powdered sugar**, **2 tbsp cacao powder**, and **3 tbsp coffee** to make the frosting. Spread or pipe the frosting onto the cake once it has cooled.

Make the cake a day or two in advance for an even moister texture.

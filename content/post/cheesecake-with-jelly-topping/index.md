### Method for cheesecake with jelly topping

#### Step 1
Crush **250 g biscuit cookies**, **1 tbsp sugar**, and **0,5 tsp cinnamon** (if using) in a food processor or using a rolling pin.

#### Step 2
Stir in **100 g melted butter** to form the crust mixture.

#### Step 3
Press mixture into a 24 cm springform pan lined with baking paper. Chill while preparing filling.

#### Step 4
Dissolve **1 pack (85 g) lemon gelatin jelly powder** in **2.5 dl boiling water**. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

#### Step 5
Mix **3 dl sour cream** and **200 g cream cheese** in a large bowl. Sift in **100 g icing sugar** and **1 tsp vanilla sugar**; stir smooth.

#### Step 6
Whip **3 dl heavy cream** to soft peaks. Gently fold into cheese mixture with a spatula.

#### Step 7
Check that the jelly is room temperature. Stir a little of the cheese mixture into the jelly, then pour the jelly in a thin stream into the cheese mixture while stirring.

#### Step 8
Pour filling onto chilled crust. Cover and refrigerate at least **4 hours**.

#### Step 9
Dissolve **1 pack (85 g) flavored gelatin jelly powder** in **2,5 dl boiling water**. Stir until dissolved and cool until just pourable.

#### Step 10
Gently pour cooled jelly over set cheesecake, using the back of a spoon to avoid bubbles. Refrigerate until jelly is set, about **2 hours**.

#### Step 11
Run a knife around the edge, release the pan, and transfer cheesecake to a serving platter.

#### Step 12
Decorate with **fresh berries** and, if desired, a sprinkle of **crushed biscuit cookies** just before serving.

## Notes:
Cheesecake keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days. Add jelly topping only after the cheese layer has completely set to avoid mixing.

### Method for Gingerbread Biscuits
#### Step 0
Prepare baking trays with baking sheets on top.

#### Step 1
Sift **350 g plain flour**, **2 tsp ground ginger**, and **1 tsp bicarbonate of soda** into a mixing bowl. Cut **100 g butter** into chunks and add them.

#### Step 2
Rub the butter into flour with your fingers until mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs.

#### Step 3
Stir **175 g light brown sugar** into the mixture. 

#### Step 4
Break **1 egg** into a small bowl, add **4 tbsp light syrup** to the egg and beat them together well.

#### Step 5
Stir the eggy mixture into the flour. Mix everything together with a metal spoon until it forms a dough.

#### Step 6
Sprinkle a clean work surface with flour and place the dough onto it. Stretch the dough by pushing it away from you.

#### Step 7
Fold the dough in half. Turn it and push it away from you again, continue to push, turn, and fold until the dough is smooth.

#### Step 8
Cut the dough in half. Sprinkle a little more flour onto your work surface. Roll out the dough until it is about 5mm thick.

#### Step 9
Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes from the dough. Lift the shapes onto the baking sheets.

#### Step 10
Roll out the other half of the dough and cut shapes from it. Squeeze the scraps of dough to make a ball. Roll it out and cut more shapes.

#### Step 11
Put the biscuits on the baking sheets into the oven and bake them for 12-15 minutes. They will turn golden brown.

#### Step 12
Leave the biscuits on the sheets for about five minutes. Then lift them onto a wire rack. Leave to cool.

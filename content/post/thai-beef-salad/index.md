### Method for Thai Beef Salad

#### Step 1 – Make dressing paste
In a mortar, grind **1/2 tsp birds eye chilli**, **1/4 tsp garlic**, **1 tbsp cilantro stems**, and **a small pinch of salt** to a smooth paste.

#### Step 2 – Finish dressing
Stir in **2 1/4 tsp sugar**, **2 tbsp fish sauce**, **3 tbsp lime juice**, and **1 tbsp grapeseed oil**. Adjust with a little more **sugar**, **lime juice**, or **fish sauce** to taste. Set aside.

#### Step 3 – Season steak
Pat **200–250 g beef steak** dry. Rub with **1/2 tbsp oil**, then season both sides with **1/4 tsp salt** and **1/4 tsp white pepper**.

#### Step 4 – Sear steak
Heat a skillet over high until very hot. Add **1 tbsp oil**, then sear steak about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare (steak about 2 cm thick, internal temp around **52°C**), or 2 1/2 minutes per side for medium (**57°C**).

#### Step 5 – Rest steak
Transfer steak to a plate, loosely tent with foil, and rest **10 minutes**.

#### Step 6 – Dress lettuce
In a bowl, toss **2 heaped cups mixed lettuce leaves** with **1 tbsp dressing**.

#### Step 7 – Assemble beef and salad
Slice rested steak thinly against the grain. In another bowl, combine sliced beef, **10 cherry tomatoes**, **1/4 small red onion**, **1/2 cucumber**, **1/4 cup cilantro leaves**, and **1/4 cup mint leaves**. Add most of the remaining dressing and toss gently.

#### Step 8 – Plate and garnish
Pile dressed lettuce on plates, top with beef mixture. Sprinkle with **1/4 cup finely chopped peanuts**, garnish with **extra cilantro leaves** and **extra mint leaves**, and drizzle with any remaining dressing. Serve immediately.

## Notes:
Best served fresh; leftovers keep up to 1 day refrigerated but herbs and lettuce will soften. Adjust chilli amount to heat preference.

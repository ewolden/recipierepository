### Method for Lutefisk
#### Step 1
Place the lutefisk skin-side down on a baking rack over a baking tray. Sprinkle generously with **1.5 tbsp salt** and refrigerate for 2-3 hours to firm up and enhance flavor.

#### Step 2
Rinse off the salt from the fish and the tray. Place the fish pieces in the tray. Season with **salt** and some ground **pepper**. Cover the tray with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at **225°C** for 30-40 minutes, depending on the size and firmness of the fish pieces.

#### Step 3
While the fish is in the oven, boil the **800 g potatoes**. It's extra nice if you peel them before boiling.

#### Step 4
Fry **400 g diced bacon** in a pan until crisp. Add a little **butter** or pork fat if needed for extra fat. Keep warm for serving. 

#### Step 5
Serve with **light syrup**, **finley grated brown cheese**, **soft potato bread**, and **mushy peas**.

### Ingredients for Classic British Fish and Chips

Ingredient | Quantity | How
---|---|---
All-purpose flour | 55 g | divided
Baking powder | 1 tsp | 
Black pepper | to taste | freshly ground
Cornstarch | 55 g | 
Dark beer | 1/3 cup | cold

Potatoes | 900 g | peeled
Sparkling water | 1/3 cup | cold
Vegetable oil | as needed | for frying
White fish fillets | 4 (200 g each) | thick

### Method for Classic British Fish and Chips

#### Step 1
Set aside **2 tbsp all-purpose flour**. In a large bowl, mix **5 tbsp all-purpose flour**, **55 g cornstarch**, and **1 tsp baking powder**. Season lightly with a pinch of **fine salt** and **black pepper**.

#### Step 2
Using a fork, whisk continuously and add **1/3 cup cold dark beer** and **1/3 cup cold sparkling water** to the flour mixture until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

#### Step 3
Meanwhile, cut **900 g peeled potatoes** into less than 1 cm thick slices, then slice these into 1 cm wide sticks. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold water.

#### Step 4
Place the washed chips into a saucepan of enough cold water to cover them by about 2.5 cm. Bring to a gentle boil over high heat, then simmer on low heat for 3 to 4 minutes.

#### Step 5
Drain, transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate, and pat dry with paper towels. Keep in the fridge covered with paper towels until needed.

#### Step 6
Lay **4 (200 g) thick white fish fillets** on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little **salt**.

#### Step 7
Heat about 8 cm of **vegetable oil** to 175°C in a deep-fryer or large, deep saucepan. Par-cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil, about 2 minutes (do not brown them). Remove the chips from the oil and drain on paper towels. Set aside.

#### Step 8
Place the **2 tbsp reserved flour** into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess. Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.

#### Step 9
Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 95°C. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. Bring the oil temperature back to 175°C. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets occasionally with a large slotted spoon, 6 to 8 minutes.

#### Step 10
Remove the fillets from the oil to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with **salt** and transfer to the oven to keep warm.

#### Step 11
Heat the oil to 205°C, then cook the chips in batches until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain. Season with **salt**.

#### Step 12
Serve immediately, accompanied by your favorite condiment and a cold pint.

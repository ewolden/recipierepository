### Method for crispy baked buffalo chicken wings

#### Step 1
If you plan ahead, lay the wings on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.

#### Step 2
Preheat the oven to 250째F/120째C (all oven types). Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter. Line the tray with foil. Put a rack on the tray then spray the rack with oil.

#### Step 3
Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly. Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug, they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.

#### Step 4
Move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 425째F / 220째C (all oven types). Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned over. They are ready when dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy.

#### Step 5
Transfer the wings into a large bowl. Pour over sauce and toss to coat. (Alternatively,serve wings plain with Buffalo Sauce for dipping).
Serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dip (for both wings and celery sticks dunking)!

### Method for buffalo sauce

#### Step 1
Whisk together the melted butter, Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce, brown sugar, and kosher salt until the sugar is melted. Keep warm or reheat just prior to using.

### Method for blue cheese dip

#### Step 1
Mash the softened blue cheese with sour cream until smooth (or to your taste).

#### Step 2
Add the minced garlic, mayonnaise, milk, lemon juice, kosher salt, and black pepper to the blue cheese and sour cream mixture. Mix well until combined, using milk to get it to the consistency you want. Store in the fridge until required. Remove from the fridge 15 minutes before serving.

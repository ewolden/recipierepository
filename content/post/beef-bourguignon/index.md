### Method for beef bourguignon
#### Step 1
Prepare **1 kg of beef** by trimming and cutting into large chunks.

#### Step 2
In a large enameled cast-iron casserole, melt **1 tbsp butter** in **1 tbps olive oil** at high heat.

#### Step 3
Preheat oven to 175°C.

#### Step 4
Arrange **1 kg beef** in a single layer and season with **salt** and **pepper**. Cook beef until browned on all sides (ca. 8 mins).

#### Step 5
Reduce heat to medium and add **2 chopped onion** and **4 cloves chopped garlic** stirring occasionally until onion is softened (ca. 5 mins).

#### Step 6
Add the **1 tbsp flour** and stir to coat the beef. Add **1 bottle red wine**, **2 bay leafs**, **1 sprig thyme** and season with **salt** and **pepper**. Bring to a boil, making sure to dissolve any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.

#### Step 7
Cover the casserole and transfer to oven. Cook stew for 1.5 hours until the meat is tender.

#### Step 8
Prepare vegetables

#### Step 9 (45 mins left of cooking stew)
Cover **150 g bacon** with **2 cups water** and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 mins. Drain the bacon and slice into 1x1cm lardons.

#### Step 10
In a large frying pan on medium-high heat pan combine **bacon lardons**, **15 pearl onions**, **15 mini mushrooms**, and **carrots**. Add **1 tbps olive oil**, **0.25 cup of water** and a large pinch of **sugar**, **salt**, and **pepper**. Bring to a boil and cover, let simmer for 10 mins. Uncover and simmer for an additional 5 mins to evaporate all water. 

#### Step 11
Turn frying pan to high heat and cook while tossing, until vegetables are tender and browned (5 mins).

Mix half of the vegetables and lardons into stew and scatter the rest on top of stew as garnish. Top with **chopped parsley**.

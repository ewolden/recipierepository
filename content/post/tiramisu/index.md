### Method for Tiramisu

#### Step 1
Set aside a **9 x 9 cm** baking or serving dish (about 2 liters capacity).

#### Step 2
Make the coffee mixture: In a wide, shallow bowl, combine **3/4 cup (175 ml) brewed espresso or strong coffee**, **3 tbsp Marsala wine**, **1 tbsp granulated sugar**, and **1/2 tsp vanilla extract**. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then set aside to cool to room temperature.

#### Step 3
Set up a double boiler: Place a heat-safe bowl over a small saucepan so it sits above **2–3 cm** simmering water without touching it. Once you know it fits, remove the bowl and bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.

#### Step 4
With the bowl off the heat, add **3 large egg yolks**, **2 tbsp Marsala wine**, and **3 tbsp granulated sugar**. Beat with a handheld mixer on medium until frothy, about 20–30 seconds.

#### Step 5
Place the bowl over the simmering water and continue beating on medium speed until the mixture is pale, thick, and tripled in volume, 5–8 minutes, forming ribbons when it falls from the beaters. Keep the water at a gentle simmer and do not stop mixing.

#### Step 6
Remove the bowl from the heat. While the zabaglione is still warm, beat in **8 oz (225 g) mascarpone cheese** just until smooth. Let cool on the counter until no longer hot.

#### Step 7
In a clean bowl with clean beaters, whip **3/4 cup (175 ml) heavy cream** with **1 tsp vanilla extract** to medium-firm peaks (the peaks hold, then gently fall back).

#### Step 8
Fold half of the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture with a spatula until just combined. Fold in the remaining whipped cream until the mixture is light and airy.

#### Step 9
Quickly dip half of the **24 ladyfingers** one by one into the coffee mixture (a brief in-and-out; do not soak), then arrange them in a single layer in the dish, trimming as needed to fit.

#### Step 10
Spread half of the mascarpone-cream mixture evenly over the ladyfingers. Grate **1 oz (30 g) bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate** evenly over the surface.

#### Step 11
Repeat with the remaining dipped **ladyfingers** to make a second layer, then spread the remaining mascarpone-cream mixture on top and grate the remaining **1 oz (30 g) chocolate** to cover.

#### Step 12
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least **6 hours** or overnight.

#### Step 13
Before serving, let the tiramisu sit at room temperature for about **20 minutes**. Add a little extra grated **chocolate** if desired, slice, and serve.

## Notes:
Keeps covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Best texture after chilling overnight. Serve straight from the fridge, allowing a brief rest at room temperature for easier slicing. Not suitable for freezing due to texture changes.

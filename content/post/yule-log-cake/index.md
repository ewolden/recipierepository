### Method for Yule Log Cake

#### Step 1 – Make sugared cranberries & rosemary (optional, night before)
In a heatproof bowl, combine **1 cup (100 g) cranberries** and **4–5 rosemary sprigs**. In a saucepan, simmer **3/4 cup (180 ml) water** with **3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar** until dissolved, then cool 5 minutes. Pour syrup over cranberries and rosemary, cover, and let sit 15 minutes. Transfer to a parchment-lined tray to dry 1 hour. Toss in remaining **1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar**, then dry at least 1 hour at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Chill, covered, up to 3 days.

#### Step 2 – Prepare pan and oven
Preheat oven to **180°C**. Grease a **30×43 cm** jelly roll pan with **nonstick spray or butter**, line with parchment, then grease parchment.

#### Step 3 – Make cake batter
Whisk **1 1/3 cups (157 g) cake flour**, **2 Tbsp (10 g) cocoa powder**, **1 tsp baking powder**, and **1/2 tsp salt** in a bowl. With a mixer and whisk attachment, beat **6 large egg whites** with **1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar** on high until stiff peaks form (4–5 minutes); transfer to another bowl. In the same mixer bowl, beat **6 large egg yolks**, remaining **1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar**, **2 Tbsp (30 ml) vegetable oil**, and **1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract** on high until thick and pale (3–4 minutes).

#### Step 4 – Combine and bake cake
Gently beat **half the whipped egg whites** into yolk mixture on low for 10 seconds, then the remaining whites for another 10 seconds. Fold in **half the flour mixture**, then the rest, just until combined. Spread batter evenly in pan, tap pan to release air bubbles, and bake 15–16 minutes until the cake springs back when lightly pressed. Do not overbake.

#### Step 5 – Roll warm cake
While cake bakes, lay a large piece of parchment or a thin kitchen towel on the counter and dust evenly with **3 Tbsp (15 g) cocoa powder**. Immediately after baking, run a knife around cake edges, invert onto cocoa-dusted surface, and peel off baking parchment. Starting from a short side, tightly roll cake up with the towel/parchment. Cool completely, rolled, about 3 hours or up to 1 day (refrigerate to speed up).

#### Step 6 – Make meringue mushrooms (optional)
Preheat oven to **93°C**. Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a clean bowl, beat **1 large egg white**, **~1/16 tsp cream of tartar**, and a **pinch of salt** on high until foamy (about 2 minutes). Gradually add **2 Tbsp (25 g) granulated sugar** and beat to stiff, glossy peaks (about 2 minutes). Pipe quarter-sized rounds (caps) and 2.5 cm tall cones (stems) onto sheet. If desired, dust caps lightly with **1/2 tsp cocoa powder**. Bake 2 hours without opening the oven, then turn off heat and leave inside 20 minutes. Cool completely.

#### Step 7 – Assemble meringue mushrooms
Melt **1 oz (28 g) semi-sweet chocolate** (microwave in 15-second bursts or in a double boiler), then cool 5–10 minutes. Lift meringues from sheet. Place a small dot of chocolate on the underside of each cap and attach a stem. Let set on the tray until chocolate hardens, about 1 hour.

#### Step 8 – Make cocoa hazelnut whipped cream
With a mixer and whisk attachment, whip **1 1/2 cups (360 ml) cold heavy cream**, **2 Tbsp (30 ml) Frangelico**, **1/4 cup (30 g) confectioners’ sugar**, and **1 Tbsp (5 g) cocoa powder** on medium-high until medium–stiff peaks form (2–3 minutes). If using, have **1/2 cup (60 g) finely chopped hazelnuts** ready.

#### Step 9 – Fill and reroll cake
Let rolled cake sit at room temperature a few minutes so it’s flexible, then unroll gently. Spread cocoa whipped cream evenly, leaving a **1 cm** border. Sprinkle over **1/2 cup (60 g) chopped hazelnuts** if using. Reroll cake without the towel, rolling slowly. Transfer to a cutting board, dust outside lightly with extra cocoa if it looks moist, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days.

#### Step 10 – Make ganache topping
Place **6 oz (170 g) finely chopped semi-sweet chocolate** in a bowl. Heat **3/4 cup (180 ml) heavy cream** in a saucepan until just simmering, then pour over chocolate. Let sit 2–3 minutes, then stir until smooth. Refrigerate, uncovered, 30–60 minutes until thickened but still spreadable.

#### Step 11 – Shape log and apply ganache
Slice a **7–10 cm** diagonal piece off one end of the chilled roll. Place main roll on a serving platter and attach the cut piece to the side as a branch, cut side against the roll. Pour or spread thickened ganache over top and sides, covering the branch and main log. Use a fork to create bark-like lines. Wipe the platter edges if needed.

#### Step 12 – Decorate and serve
Just before serving, decorate with meringue mushrooms, sugared cranberries, and sugared rosemary, and dust lightly with **confectioners’ sugar**. Slice and serve.

## Notes:
Keeps covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days after assembling with ganache. The rolled, filled cake (before ganache) can be refrigerated up to 2 days. Sugared cranberries, rosemary, and meringue mushrooms can be made up to 3 days ahead and stored airtight (cranberries in the fridge, mushrooms at room temperature in a dry place).

### Method for Creamy Chicken Pasta

#### Step 1
Boil water for the **350 g tagliatelle**.

#### Step 2
Cut the **3 pieces chicken** horizontally in half. Cut **150 g bacon or prosciutto** into small pieces. Season the chicken with **salt** and **pepper**.

#### Step 3
Heat a large skillet with some **olive oil**. Cook the bacon or prosciutto until crispy, then transfer to a plate or small bowl.

#### Step 4
In the same skillet, cook the chicken on both sides until golden and cooked through. Remove from the skillet.

#### Step 5
Wipe the skillet and add **1 tbsp butter** (or use the bacon fat). Add **2 cloves finely chopped garlic** and **1 finely chopped shallot**. Sauté until the shallot is soft and golden.

#### Step 6
Cook the pasta al dente. Reserve **2 dl of the pasta cooking water**.

#### Step 7
Add **3 dl whipping cream** and **2 dl pasta cooking water** to the skillet with the shallot. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes until slightly thickened.

#### Step 8
Stir in **1.5 dl grated parmesan** and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

#### Step 9
Combine the pasta with the sauce, stirring until the sauce clings to the pasta. If the sauce is too thick, add more pasta water; if too thin, cook longer to thicken.

#### Step 10
Add the bacon, **chopped chicken**, and **1 bunch chopped parsley**. Serve immediately with extra **parmesan**.

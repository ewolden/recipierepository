## Classic Scones with Jam & Clotted Cream

### Ingredients for Classic Scones with Jam & Clotted Cream
Ingredient | Quantity | How
---|---|---
Self-raising flour | 350 g | plus more for dusting
Baking powder | 1 tsp | 
Butter | 85 g | cut into cubes
Caster sugar | 3 tbsp | 
Milk | 175 ml | 
Vanilla extract | 1 tsp | 
Lemon juice | 1 squeeze | 
Beaten egg | 1 | for glazing
Jam | to serve | 
Clotted cream | to serve | 

### Method for Classic Scones with Jam & Clotted Cream

#### Step 1
Heat the oven to **220°C/200°C fan**. Tip **350 g self-raising flour** into a large bowl with **1/4 tsp salt** and **1 tsp baking powder**, then mix.

#### Step 2
Add the **85 g butter**, then rub in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the **3 tbsp caster sugar**.

#### Step 3
Put the **175 ml milk** into a jug and heat in the microwave for about **30 secs** until warm, but not hot. Add the **1 tsp vanilla extract** and a **squeeze of lemon juice**, then set aside for a moment.

#### Step 4
Put a baking tray in the oven. Make a well in the dry mix, then add the liquid and combine it quickly with a cutlery knife – it will seem pretty wet at first.

#### Step 5
Scatter some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough out. Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it’s a little smoother. Pat into a round about **4 cm** deep. Take a **5 cm** cutter (smooth-edged cutters tend to cut more cleanly, giving a better rise) and dip it into some flour. Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have four scones. You may need to press what’s left of the dough back into a round to cut out another four.

#### Step 6
Brush the tops with a **beaten egg**, then carefully arrange on the hot baking tray. Bake for **10 mins** until risen and golden on the top. Eat just warm or cold on the day of baking, generously topped with **jam** and **clotted cream**. 

If freezing, freeze once cool. Defrost, then put in a low oven (about **160°C/140°C fan**) for a few minutes to refresh.

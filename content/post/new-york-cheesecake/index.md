### Method for New York Cheesecake
#### Step 1
Position an oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to **180°C** (160°C fan/ gas 4).

#### Step 2
Line the base of a **23 cm** springform cake tin with parchment paper or foil.

#### Step 3
Melt **85 g butter** in a medium pan. Stir in **140 g digestive biscuit crumbs** and **1 tbsp sugar** until evenly moistened.

#### Step 4
Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling.

#### Step 5
Increase the oven temperature to **220°C** (200°C fan/ gas 7). Beat **900 g full-fat soft cheese** in a mixer at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.

#### Step 6
Gradually add **250 g golden caster sugar**, then **3 tbsp plain flour** and a pinch of **salt**, scraping down the sides of the bowl twice.

#### Step 7
Switch to the whisk attachment. Add **1½ tsp vanilla extract**, **2 tsp lemon zest**, and **1½ tsp lemon juice**. Whisk in **3 large eggs** and **1 yolk**, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk twice.

#### Step 8
Stir **200 ml soured cream** until smooth, then add to the mixture. Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat.

#### Step 9
Brush the sides of the tin with melted butter and place on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling, smoothing the top. Bake for 10 minutes.

#### Step 10
Reduce oven temperature to **110°C/90°C fan** and bake for 45 minutes more. The filling should have a slight wobble when the tin is gently shaken.

#### Step 11
Turn off the oven and open the door for a creamy centre, or leave it closed for a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours.

#### Step 12
Mix the reserved soured cream with **150 ml soured cream**, **1 tbsp sugar**, and **2 tsp lemon juice** for the topping. Whisk **100 ml double cream** and fold sour cream mixture in. Spread over the cheesecake and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.

#### Step 13
Run a knife around the tin's sides to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake onto a plate, then remove the parchment paper.

### Method for Cinnamon Rolls

### Step 1 - Get ingredients to room temperature
Ensure you have **200g of butter** at room temperature, and **1 egg** at room temperature.

#### Step 2 – Make the tangzhong
In a small pot, whisk **25 g bread flour** with **125 g whole milk** until smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking, until thick like mashed potatoes. Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature.

#### Step 3 – Activate the yeast
From the dough milk, warm about **100 ml whole milk** to 38–40°C. Stir in **7 g active dry yeast** and a pinch of the **60 g granulated sugar**. Rest 10 minutes until foamy.

#### Step 4 – Mix the dough in the Kenwood
In the Kenwood bowl, add **475 g bread flour**, remaining **granulated sugar** (from the **60 g** total), and **10 g fine salt**. Add the cooled tangzhong, the yeast mixture, **1 large egg**, and the remaining milk from the **170 g whole milk** (start by adding enough to total **170 g** including what you used to activate the yeast). Using the dough hook on speed 1–2, mix 2–3 minutes until shaggy.

#### Step 5 – Knead and add butter
Increase to speed 2–3 and knead 6–8 minutes until the dough starts to look smooth. Add **60 g very soft unsalted butter** in 3–4 additions while mixing. Continue kneading 8–10 minutes until very elastic and it passes the windowpane test. If dough feels stiff, add extra milk from the **170 g** allowance (or a little more) **1 tbsp at a time** until soft and slightly tacky. Stop when the dough clears the bowl sides but still lightly sticks to the bottom.

#### Step 6 – First rise
Shape the dough into a ball, place in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise at warm room temperature until doubled and puffy, about 60–90 minutes. Optionally do one gentle stretch and fold after 30 minutes, lifting and folding the dough over itself with wet hands.

#### Step 7 – Prepare filling
In a bowl, combine **150 g brown sugar**, **2 tbsp cinnamon**, and **½ tsp fine salt**. In a separate dish, ensure **80 g very soft unsalted butter** is ready to spread.

#### Step 8 – Roll, fill, and shape
Lightly flour your work surface. Roll the risen dough into a rectangle about 35 x 45 cm. Spread the surface evenly with **80 g very soft butter**. Sprinkle the cinnamon mixture (from **150 g brown sugar**, **2 tbsp cinnamon**, **½ tsp salt**) evenly over the butter. Roll up tightly from the long side into a log. Cut into 12 equal rolls and place them in a lined or buttered 23 x 33 cm pan, leaving slight space between rolls.

#### Step 9 – Second rise
Cover the pan and let the rolls rise at warm room temperature until very puffy and jiggly, 45–75 minutes. When lightly pressed, the dough should slowly spring back.

#### Step 10 – Bake with cream
Heat the oven to 175°C (or 165°C fan). Just before baking, pour **120 ml heavy cream** (or **100 ml milk** mixed with **20 g melted butter**) evenly around and over the risen rolls. Bake 20–26 minutes until lightly golden; the center of a roll should be about 88–93°C. Do not overbake.

#### Step 11 – Make the icing
While the rolls bake or cool slightly, beat **120 g soft cream cheese** (if using) with **60 g soft unsalted butter** until smooth. Gradually add **120–180 g powdered sugar**, then **1–2 tbsp milk**, **½ tsp vanilla**, and **1 pinch salt**, beating until smooth and spreadable.

#### Step 12 – Finish
Let the rolls cool 10–15 minutes in the pan, then spread the icing made with **cream cheese**, **butter**, **powdered sugar**, **milk**, **vanilla**, and **salt** over the warm rolls. Serve warm.

## Notes:
Best the day they are baked. Once cool, store covered at room temperature up to 1 day or refrigerated up to 3 days; reheat briefly in a 150°C oven or microwave until just warm. The cream bath and avoiding overbaking are key to keeping the rolls soft and not dense.

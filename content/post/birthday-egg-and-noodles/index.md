## Birthday Noodles
### Ingredients for Birthday Noodles
Ingredient | Quantity | How
---|---|---
Boiled eggs | 4 | dyed pink
Fine noodles | 1 packet | 
Red food dye |  | 
Sugar | 1-4 tbsp | 
Water | 2 cups | for soup and noodles

### Method for Birthday Noodles
#### Step 1
Boil **4 eggs**, peel them, and let them cool.

#### Step 2
Boil two small pans of **water**, one for the noodles and one for the soup.

#### Step 3
Add **red food dye** to the boiled eggs to turn them pink. Leave to set.

#### Step 4
For the soup, add **1 tbsp sugar** to one cup of boiling water. Taste and add more sugar according to preference. 

#### Step 5
In the other pan, cook the **fine noodles**. Be cautious not to overcook; they should be slightly undercooked as they will continue to cook when the sugar soup is added.

#### Step 6
Combine the noodles and the sweet soup in a bowl. Place the pink-dyed eggs on top and serve.

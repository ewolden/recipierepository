### Method for Instant Stovetop Naans
#### Step 1
Pour **125 ml milk** and **110 ml water** into a large mixing bowl. Add the **egg**, **1 tsp salt**, **1.5 tbsp sugar**, and **1.5 tsp nigella seeds** and whisk well.

#### Step 2
Slowly pour in the **250 g flour**, whisking continuously. The mixture will appear soupy. You may choose to cover the dough with a wet cloth and let it sit for 3 hours or overnight for optimal results.

#### Step 3
When ready to make the naans, gradually add more self-rising flour until the dough is soft and slightly sticky. For reference, approximately 7 handfuls of flour were added in the original recipe.

#### Step 4
Divide the dough into **six spongy dough balls**. Let them sit covered for about 30 minutes or move directly to the next step.

#### Step 5
Using oiled fingers, flatten the dough balls without needing a rolling pin. Brush the tops lightly with **canola oil**.

#### Step 6
In a heated pan over medium-high heat, place the naan in it, oil side up. As it cooks, bubbles will form. Use a blow torch to brown the bubbles if available. If using a gas stove with a cast iron pan, turn the naan towards the flame. Otherwise, flipping is an option. Brush with melted **ghee** or **butter** to serve.

#### Step 7
Keep warm and repeat for the remaining naans.

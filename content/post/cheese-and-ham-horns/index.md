### Method for Cheese and Ham Horns
#### Step 1
In a bowl, combine **1 kg flour**, **1 packet dry yeast**, **2 tbsp sugar**, and **1 tsp salt**. Melt **65 g margarine** and warm **2.5 dl milk** and **3 dl water** to **26-28°C**. Mix the liquid into the dry ingredients using a kitchen machine. Let the dough rise for about 1 hour until it doubles in size.

#### Step 2
Divide the dough into three parts. Roll each part into a round pizza shape and cut into six triangles. Place a slice of **ham** and two slices of **white cheese** on each triangle, then roll up from the wide end.

#### Step 3
Place the horns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, ensuring the tip is underneath. Let rise under a cloth for about 20 minutes.

#### Step 4
Brush the horns with beaten **egg** and sprinkle with **sesame seeds**. Bake at **200°C** for 15-20 minutes until golden. Cool on a rack.

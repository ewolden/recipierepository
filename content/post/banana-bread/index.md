### Method for Banana Bread
#### Step 1
Preheat the oven to **175°C**. Butter an **8x20 cm** loaf pan.

#### Step 2
In a mixing bowl, mash the **2 to 3 medium bananas** with a fork until completely smooth. Stir in the **1/3 cup melted butter**.

#### Step 3
Mix in the **1/2 tsp baking soda** and **pinch of salt**. Stir in the **3/4 cup sugar**, **1 beaten egg**, and **1 tsp vanilla extract**. Mix in the **1 1/2 cups flour**.

#### Step 4
Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.

#### Step 5
Bake for **55 to 65 minutes** at **175°C**, or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.

#### Step 6
Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve.

Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.
